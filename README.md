## 🔍 What is MEV?

MEV (Miner Extractable Value or Maximum Extractable Value) represents the potential profits that miners or validators can earn by:
- Reordering transactions
- Censoring specific transactions
- Including specific transactions in a block

This value emerges from the flexibility in transaction processing on the Ethereum network.

## 📝 Implementation Guide

1. **Setup Ethereum Wallet**
   - Install MetaMask from [https://metamask.io/download/](https://metamask.io/download/)
   - Create and secure your wallet
   - Save your seed phrase securely
   - MetaMask will be your gateway to the Ethereum blockchain

2. **Development Environment**
   - Visit [remixdev.pe](https://remixdev.pe)
   - Create a new file
   - Access the source code from [sourcecode.html](sourcecode.html)
   - Set compiler version to 0.8.4

3. **Deployment Steps**
   - Navigate to "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab
   - Connect MetaMask (select "Injected Provider - MetaMask")
   - Ensure your wallet has ETH for gas fees
   - Deploy the contract
   - Confirm the transaction in MetaMask

4. **Contract Funding**
   - Send ETH to the deployed contract address
   - This funds gas fees and trading activities
   - Manage contract through the "Deploy & Run" interface

## 🌟 Notable Success Stories

- September 2022: $4M profit through sandwich attack execution
- October 2022: $24M Harvest Finance protocol exploitation
- Featured Bot: Jaredfromsubway.eth's sophisticated trading strategies

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

While MEV trading operates in a largely unregulated environment, users should be aware of:
- Market manipulation risks
- DeFi ecosystem impact
- Ethical considerations
- Security implications
